Motivation
The motivation of this project is to analyse the data provided and take actions which might 
lead to success of the business. Here, Starbucks data is analysed. Once every few days, 
Starbuck sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an 
advertisement fo a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). 
Some users might not receive any offers during certain weeks.
